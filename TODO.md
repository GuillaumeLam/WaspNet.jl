- [ ] `Network` constructor method to take FF layers and make FF network without specifying connections
- [ ] Generalize `Network` constructor function so all methods call to one primary method
- [ ] Utility to generate networks of varying widths
- [ ] Utility functions should not assume inputs are connected *directly* to neurons

- [ ] HH Neuron Model (including tests)
- [ ] QIF Neuron Model (including tests)
- [ ] FNH Neuron Model (including tests)

- [ ] Tests for all utility functions in multiple use-cases
- [ ] Tests for heterogeneous networks

- [ ] Test all `Layer` method
